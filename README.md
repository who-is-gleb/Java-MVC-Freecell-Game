# Java-MVC-Freecell-Game

   HI! This is an example of my work. Here I implemented an MVC design pattern on Java.

   Please notice: there is no View implementation here, my purpose is to show my Model and Controller implementation for my portfolio. The View implementation here is done inside the Model's method "getGameState( )". It returns a String. 
   
   DESCRIPTION:
   
   Freecell Game is a card game. There are three types of piles of cards: foundation, open, and cascade piles. Each pile type is represented as List<List<Card>>. There can be many foundation, open, and cascade piles, each pile from a certain type can hold many cards. Thus, it is a 2d list of Card.  
    
    
   LAUNCHING THE GAME:
   
   You can launch the game by launching the Main method. As an example of input, you can give "C1 13 F1". I won't dig deeper into the rules here, but let me know if you want to know them :)  
   
   
   IMPORTANT NOTES: 
   
   P.S. This is the project that I created during my OOD Java class at Northeastern University. Thus, it has a structure of src/cs3500.freecell/hw02, hw03, etc.  
    
   P.S.S. I did not create Interfaces, TypeCheck classes, or FailingAppendable class. We were provided with them by our university professors.
